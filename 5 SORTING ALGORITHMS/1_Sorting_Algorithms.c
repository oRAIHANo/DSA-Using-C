=> Order of Sorting
1) Ascending - Increasing order {1,2,3,4,5}
2) Decending - Decreasing order {5,4,3,2,1}

=> Application of Sorting Algorithms
=> Where these Sorting Algorithms are used in the real world.
1) To Sort the contact list on the phone.
2) Online shopping - Sort according to prize, customer review. Example - Amazon, Flipcart.
3) Online Ordering - Sort according to prize, top rated. Example - Zomato, Swiggy.
4) YouTube comments - Sort according to new comments or top rated.

=> Criteria For Analysis of Sorting Algorithms
1) Time Complexity - Time taken by your algorithm to sort an array.
2) Space Complexity - How much space you your algorithm is taking.
3) Stability - A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted. 
Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
Example of Stability
Before sorting(Input Array) - {1,4,2,2,1}
After Sorting(Output Array) - {1,1,2,2,4} 
1 that appeared first before sorting is kept as the first element after sorting in this way order is maintained.
1 that appeared last before sorting is kept as the second element after sorting in this way order is maintained.
1 that appeared last before sorting cannot be inserted as the first element after sorting.
4) Internal Sorting Algorithm - All the data is loaded into the memory
External Sorting Algorithm - All the data is not loaded into the memory
5) Adaptive - Already sorted data takes less time
6) Recursive/Non Recursive - Recursive if it uses recursion
