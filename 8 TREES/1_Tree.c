Tree is a non linear data structure

Tree is an ideal data structure for representing hierarchical data.
Tree data structures are useful because they allow you to store and organize data in a hierarchical and logical manner.
Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the hierarchical form then it can be represented using a tree.

Terminologies used in trees

Root
The topmost node of a tree is called the root. 
There is no edge pointing to it, but one or more than one edge originating from it.

Parent
Any node which connects to the child. 
Node which has an edge pointing to some other node.

Child
Any node which is connected to a parent node. 
Node which has an edge pointing to it from some other node.

Siblings
Nodes belonging to the same parent are called siblings of each other. 
Nodes B, C and D are siblings of each other, since they have the same parent node A.

Ancestors
Nodes accessible by following up the edges from a child node upwards are called the ancestors of that node. 
Ancestors are also the parents of the parents of that node.

Descendants
Nodes accessible by following up the edges from a parent node downwards are called the descendants of that node. 
Descendants are also the child of the child of that node.

Leaf/ External Node
Nodes which have no edge originating from it, and have no child attached to it. 
These nodes cannot be a parent.

Internal node
Nodes with at least one child.

Depth
Depth of a node is the number of edges from root to that node. 

Height
Height of a node is the number of edges from that node to the deepest leaf. 

Tree is made up of nodes & edges.

n nodes = n-1 edges

Degree = number of direct children from a node.

Degree of a tree is the highest degree of a node among all the nodes present in a tree.
